## Installation

### GitHub repository setup

1. Create new repository from `@mern-monorepo-starter` template [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=monorepo-mern-railway-starter&template_owner=brunotot).

2. Navigate to **Repo > Settings > Actions - General** and save the following Workflow-related options:

   1. `Read and write permissions` checked
   2. `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` checked

3. Now GitHub actions are ready for usage. Let's now re-run the autogenerated TypeDoc workflow so it generates the `gh-pages` branch. Navigate to **Repo > Actions > MERN Sample App - TypeDoc** and click on **Run workflow**

4. After the `gh-pages` branch is generated, navigate to **Repo > Settings > Pages** and save the `gh-pages` branch as the deployment branch.

5. That's it! Now your GitHub repository is ready to be used for deployment

### Local installation

1. Clone the previously created repository to your local machine

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/REPO_USER/REPO_NAME.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the cloned one from Step **#1**

   ```sh
   cd REPO_NAME
   ```

3. Install local packages and run prepare scripts

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. That's it! Now you may open the project in **VSCode**
   ```sh
   code .
   ```
