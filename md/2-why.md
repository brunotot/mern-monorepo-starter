## Why

The motivation behind creating this MERN monorepo starter was to simplify the process of full application development and deployment. We aimed to craft a GitHub repository that serves as a comprehensive guide for developersâ€”whether it's me or anyone else in the developer community. The core idea was to provide a central, ready-to-use setup that encapsulates all best practices for using a monorepo with a 100% TypeScript implementation.

This repository is designed to streamline the entire workflow, from local development to full-scale deployment on cloud platforms, starting with Railway. Future updates will include detailed steps for other platforms like Heroku to ensure flexibility and broader applicability. By following the instructions laid out in this template, developers can deploy a production-ready application on Railway, equipped with robust CI/CD pipelines, automated documentation generation, comprehensive testing, and much more.

The goal is to remove the complexities typically associated with setting up and deploying modern web applications, allowing developers to focus more on building great features and less on the intricacies of the deployment and operational processes.
