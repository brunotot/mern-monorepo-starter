## Why

The motivation behind creating this MERN monorepo starter was to simplify application development and deployment. It offers a ready-to-use, opinionated setup with best practices for a TypeScript monorepo.

The repository streamlines the workflow from local development to cloud deployment, starting with Railway. Future updates will cover platforms like Heroku. Follow this template to deploy a production-ready app with CI/CD, automated documentation, and testing.

Our goal is to provide an easy setup and deployment process, allowing developers to focus on building features while ensuring the development environment follows best practices.
